## üìã Types of Contributions

### üêõ Bug Reports
- Use the issue tracker to report bugs
- Include system information (macOS version, app version)
- Provide clear steps to reproduce
- Include logs if available

### üí° Feature Requests
- Check existing issues first
- Clearly describe the use case
- Explain why this would be useful
- Consider implementation complexity

### üîß Code Contributions
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep changes focused and atomic

### üìö Documentation
- Improve existing documentation
- Add code comments for complex logic
- Update README or ARCHITECTURE.md
- Fix typos and grammar

## üèóÔ∏è Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Follow the architecture patterns established in the codebase
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Write meaningful commit messages

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Build and run the app
‚åò + R

# Run unit tests (when available)
‚åò + U

# Test manually with different scenarios
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"

# Use conventional commit format:
# feat: new feature
# fix: bug fix
# docs: documentation
# style: formatting
# refactor: code restructuring
# test: adding tests
# chore: maintenance
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear title and description
- Reference any related issues
- Screenshots if UI changes
- Test instructions

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Swift Style
- Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer `let` over `var` when possible
- Use type inference where appropriate

### Architecture
- Follow the established architecture patterns
- Use protocols for testability
- Implement proper error handling
- Maintain single responsibility principle

### Comments
```swift
/// Brief description of what this function does
/// - Parameter value: Description of the parameter
/// - Returns: Description of return value
func processValue(_ value: String) -> Result<Data, RemeetnerError> {
    // Implementation comments for complex logic
}
```

### SwiftUI
- Use `@State` for local view state
- Use `@ObservedObject` for external models
- Extract complex views into separate structs
- Use preview providers for development
